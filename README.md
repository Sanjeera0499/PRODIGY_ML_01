Title: Predicting House Prices Using Linear Regression
Background:
The real estate market is influenced by various factors, including the size of the house (square footage), the number of bedrooms, and the number of bathrooms. Understanding how these factors influence house prices can provide valuable insights for buyers, sellers, and real estate agents. A predictive model can help in making informed decisions by estimating the price of a house based on its characteristics.

Objective:
Develop a linear regression model to predict the prices of houses based on their square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The model will help to understand the relationship between these features and the house prices, and provide accurate price predictions for given house features.

Data:
The dataset for this problem should include the following columns:

Square Footage: The size of the house in square feet.
Number of Bedrooms: The total number of bedrooms in the house.
Number of Bathrooms: The total number of bathrooms in the house.
Price: The selling price of the house.

Tasks:
Data Collection: Obtain a dataset containing information on house prices, square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure that the data is in a suitable format for modeling.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Perform EDA to understand the distribution of the data and the relationships between the features and the target variable (price).

Model Development:
Split the data into training and testing sets.
Develop a linear regression model using the training set.
Evaluate the model using the testing set.

Model Evaluation: Assess the performance of the model using appropriate metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Interpretation: Interpret the model coefficients to understand the impact of each feature on house prices.
Prediction: Use the trained model to predict house prices for new data.

Expected Outcome:
A linear regression model capable of predicting house prices based on square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms.
Insights into how each feature influences house prices.
A report detailing the model development process, evaluation results, and interpretation of findings.

Constraints:
The dataset should have a sufficient number of samples to train a reliable model.
The data should be representative of the housing market to ensure generalizability of the model.

Tools and Technologies:
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
